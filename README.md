# UEL - Universal Educational Language
## What is `UEL`?
`UEL` (pronounced "yuel") is a scripting language designed for easy-to-understand coding for education and teaching basic programming principles. It has COBOL's English-like syntax, but is less verbose without losing clarity.

## Getting Started
Since `UEL` is still in its design stage, there are no ways to getting started yet. This section will be updated once a toolchain is available for `UEL`.
